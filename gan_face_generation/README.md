This project is a GAN that generates faces. The training set is 262K celebrity faces. The generator and the discriminator each include three convolutional layers with Leaky RELUs as activation functions. The generator's output layer is a transpose convolutional layer to upsample the image. The discriminator's convolutional layers are connected with a dense layer as output. 

Here are some examples of images generated by the network:
